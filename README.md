This is a practical project on learning some core concepts of software deelopment/web deelopment with django.
 
Please visit https://swiss-social.herokuapp.com/ 

to test the application out.

This application is for sharing images/pictures found on the internet, first we created a javascript snippet that each users can load on thier web browser, but due to security reasons of loading jquery to or a code to the existing page this doesnt work on many websites, but worked on pinterest.com for example.

1 users registration and signup edit profile
2 users upload images and other users can like this image
3 we have created a ranking system by view using redis for optimization
4 using django contentype we have created a function to monitore events of our models
5 we create user follow system and restrict post to only users that follows

this project is under development incase you are interested in joing and learning together or pointing me to some practical improvements it will be appreciated 

And i am developing this hoping be a backend engineer with python and django.
also to show under my projects for Hiring managers.

Thank you.
